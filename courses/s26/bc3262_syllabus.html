    </p>

    <h4>Course Description</h4>
    <p>
      This course is an introduction to modern cryptography, focusing on the complexity-theoretic foundations of secure computation and communication in adversarial environments, precise definitions, and provably secure protocols. Topics include private and public key encryption schemes, digital signatures, authentication, pseudorandom generators and functions, one-way functions, trapdoor functions, number theory and computational hardness, identification and zero knowledge protocols.
    </p>

    <h4>Learning Outcomes</h4>
    <p>
      <ul>
        <li>Interpret cryptographic definitions and security proofs (i.e., what is and what is not guaranteed?)</li>
        <li>Understand computational assumptions and their implications in cryptography</li>
        <li>Recognize limitations of what is possible to achieve</li>
        <li>Develop skills to rigorously prove security or assess validity of claimed security of cryptographic constructions according to established definitions</li>
      </ul>
    </p>

    <h4>Materials</h4>
    <p>
      The recommended textbooks for this course are "Introduction to Modern Cryptography" by Jonathan Katz and Yehuda Lindell and "The Joy of Cryptography" by Mike Rosulek. There will not be any assignments or assigned readings from the text, but they are useful references to assist in understanding the lectures.
    </p>

    <h4>Prerequisites</h4>
    <p>Required: COMS W3203 (Discrete Mathematics) or equivalent<br>
      Recommended: COMS W3261 (Computer Science Theory)<br><br>
      Students are expected to be comfortable with discrete math, probability, Big-O notation, and basic reasoning about algorithms (such as correctness and runtime). Students will be expected to understand and write formal definitions and proofs.
<br>
      While not required, it is helpful for students to have a background in CS theory, probability theory, and basic number theory. These topics will be briefly covered in the class as needed. 
    </p>

    <h4>Grading</h4>
    <p>
      This course involves problem sets, a written midterm exam, and written final exam. Assignments are weighted as follows: 
      <ul>
        <li>
          <b>Problem Sets (40%)</b>:There will be problem sets due roughly every couple of weeks. Students are allowed and encouraged to collaborate in small groups, though each student must individually write and submit solutions. The lowest problem set grade will be dropped.
        </li>
        <li>
          <b>Midterm (25%)</b>: There will be a in-person written exam roughly midway through the semester. No collaboration is permitted on the exam. Students are allowed to bring a single letter-sized reference sheet, but no other external resources are permitted.
        </li>
        <li>
          <b>Final Exam (35%)</b>: At the end of the semester, there will be a in-person written exam. Similar to the midterm, no collaboration or external resources are allowed apart from a single letter-sized reference sheet.
        </li>
      </ul>
    </p>

    <h4>Course Policies</h4>
    <h5>Collaborations</h5>
    <p>
      Every student must individually write and submit solutions to the homework problems assigned. Students are encouraged to discuss problems with one another and work toward solutions in small groups of their choosing. <em>Students must include a written acknowledgment in their homework submissions if problems were discussed and with whom.</em> 
      <br><br>
      The point of homework discussions is to help you understand the material: it is not acceptable to simply swap solutions, and every student should be able to orally explain every solution they submit. <em>Looking at written homework solutions from the internet or other people is prohibited (this includes letting other students read your answers).</em>
    </p>

    <h5>Late Assignments</h5>
    <p>
      Assignments will incur a penalty of 10% of the total possible points per day it is late, up until 3 days. After 72 hours beyond the due date, no assignments will be accepted for credit.  The lowest problem set grade will be dropped.
    </p>

    <h5>Re-grades</h5>
    <p>Students may request regrades for a week following the release of a grade, after which, regrades will be closed. Regrade requests are intended to address potential grading errors, not to serve as an avenue for negotiation.</p>


    <h5>Generative AI Policy</h5>
    <p>
      The use of generative AI for anything related to assignments is prohibited in this class, at any stage. In particular, <em>it is always forbidden to input any substantive portion of any assignment into any kind of AI resource</em>. It is also always forbidden to incorporate any substantive portion of an AI resource's output into your answers, even if you paraphrase it or rewrite it in your own words. If you think that the instructor might refuse to perform a certain task for you or answer a certain question during office hours, then you should definitely not be asking an AI resource to perform the same task or answer the same question. 
    </p>

      <h4>Barnard Honor Code</h4>

      <p>
        You are expected to hold yourself to the highest standard of academic integrity and honesty, as reflected in the Barnard Honor Code. Approved by the student body in 1912 and updated in 2016, the Code states:
      </p>
      <blockquote style="margin-left:2em ;margin-right:2em">
        <p>We, the students of Barnard College, resolve to uphold the honor of the College by engaging with integrity in all of our academic pursuits. We affirm that academic integrity is the honorable creation and presentation of our own work. We acknowledge that it is our responsibility to seek clarification of proper forms of collaboration and use of academic resources in all assignments or exams. We consider academic integrity to include the proper use and care for all print, electronic, or other academic resources. We will respect the rights of others to engage in pursuit of learning in order to uphold our commitment to honor. We pledge to do all that is in our power to create a spirit of honesty and honor for its own sake.</p>
      </blockquote>

      <h4>Wellness Statement</h4>
      <p>It is important for undergraduates to recognize and identify the different pressures,
      burdens, and stressors you may be facing, whether personal, emotional, physical,
      financial, mental, or academic. We as a community urge you to make yourself–
      your own health, sanity, and wellness–your priority throughout this term and your
      career here. Sleep, exercise, and eating well can all be a part of a healthy regimen
      to cope with stress. Resources exist to support you in several sectors of your life,
      and we encourage you to make use of them. Should you have any questions about
      navigating these resources, please visit these sites:
      <ul>
        <li><a href="http://barnard.edu/primarycare" target="_blank">http://barnard.edu/primarycare</a></li>
        <li><a href="https://barnard.edu/about-counseling" target="_blank">https://barnard.edu/about-counseling</a></li>

      </ul>
      </p>

      <h4>Center for Accessibility Resources & Disability Services</h4>
      <p>If you anticipate barriers to your academic experience due to a documented disability or emerging health challenge, please contact your instructor and/or the Center for Accessibility Resources & Disability Services (CARDS) as early as possible. If you have questions regarding registering a disability or receiving accommodations for the semester, contact CARDS at (212) 854-4634 or cards@barnard.edu. You can learn more about on-campus support at barnard.edu/disability-services. CARDS is located in 101 Altschul Hall.</p>

      <h4>Affordable Access to Course Texts and Materials</h4>
      <p>
        All students deserve to be able to study and make use of course texts and materials
        regardless of cost. Barnard librarians have partnered with students, faculty, and staff to
        find ways to increase student access to textbooks. By the first day of advance
        registration for each term, faculty will have provided information about required texts for
        each course on CourseWorks (including ISBN or author, title, publisher, copyright date,
        and price), which can be viewed by students. A number of cost-free or low-cost
        methods for accessing some types of courses texts are detailed on the <a href="https://library.barnard.edu/textbook-affordability" target="_blank">Barnard Library
        Textbook Affordability</a> guide. Undergraduate students who identify as first-generation
        and/or low-income students may check out items from the <a href="https://library.barnard.edu/find-borrow/FLIpartnership" target="_blank">FLI lending libraries in the
        Barnard Library</a> and in <a href="https://library.columbia.edu/libraries/undergraduate/FLI_partnership_library.html" target="_blank">Butler Library</a> for an entire semester. Students may also consult
        with their professors, the Dean of Studies, and the Financial Aid Office about additional
        affordable alternatives for having access to course texts. Visit the guide and talk to your
        professors and your librarian for more details.
