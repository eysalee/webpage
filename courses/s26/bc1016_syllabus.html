      <h4>Course Description</h4>
      <p>
      This course and its co-requisite lab course will introduce students to the methods and tools used in data science to obtain insights from data. Students will learn how to analyze data arising from real-world phenomena while mastering critical concepts and skills in computer programming and statistical inference. The course will involve hands-on analysis of real-world datasets, including economic data, document collections, geographical data, and social networks. The course is ideal for students looking to increase their digital literacy and expand their use and understanding of computation and data analysis across disciplines. No prior programming or college-level math background is required.</p>

      <h4>Learning Outcomes</h4>
      <p>
        <ul>
          <li>Learn how to <em>explore</em> datasets by visualizing data to identify patterns</li>
          <li>Conduct statistical analyses to draw <em>inferences</em> about the world</li>
          <li>Use data to make <em>predictions</em> about possible outcomes using models</li>
          <li>Gain familiarity with programming in Python and experience analyzing data, building visualizations, and running statistical tests using Jupyter Notebooks</li>
        </ul>
      </p>

      <h4>Materials</h4>
      <p>
      This course is based on <a href="https://www.data8.org/" target="_blank">UC Berkeley’s Foundation of Data Science course</a> and their <a href="https://inferentialthinking.com/chapters/intro.html" target="_blank">Computational and Inferential Thinking textbook</a>. Students will complete lab and homework assignments using cloud-based JupyterHub notebooks that can be accessed in the browser, so no software will need to be installed as part of this course.
    </p>

      <h4>Grading</h4>
      <p>
      This course involves weekly labs, homework assignments, a written midterm exam, and a final project. There is no final exam for this course.</p>
      
      <p>
      Final grades are based on the instructor's holistic evaluation of your performance and follow <a href="https://catalog.barnard.edu/barnard-college/academic-policies-procedures/grading-academic-honors/" target="_blank">Barnard's grading system</a>.
      As a general guideline, assignments are weighted as follows:
      <ul>
        <li>35% - Homework Assignments</li>
        <li>25% - Midterm Exam</li>
        <li>40% - Final Project</li>
      </ul>
      </p>

      <h5>Lab Sections</h5>
      <p>
        Lab grades are weighted 50% for attendance and 50% for lab assignments.
      All lab assignments are graded out of 5 points. You receive 5 points for a fully complete + correct notebook. If your notebook is partially complete / correct but shows effort, you will receive 3 points. To submit your lab, you should ensure that all grader cells have been run (grader.check_all()) and submit your notebook to Gradescope.
      </p>
      <p>
      If you are going to be late for lab or unable to attend, you must email your lab TA in advance. If you don’t come to lab or don’t email the TA in advance, you will receive 0 points for that day's attendance.
      You are permitted one unexcused absence from lab during the semester.

      </p>

      <h5>Re-grade Requests</h5>
      <p>Any requests for regrades of assignments must be received within 1 week after the grade was received.  If you request a regrade, we reserve the right to lower your grade if, upon re-review of your assignment, the original grading was found to be too generous.  Any requests for regrades after this timeframe will not be considered.</p>

      <h5>Late Policy</h5>
      <p>Assignments may be submitted up to 5 days after the deadline for a penalty: 
      <ul>
        <li>Less than 24 hours: 10% deduction</li>
        <li>Between 1 and 2 days: 20% deduction</li>
        <li>Between 2 and 3 days: 30% deduction</li>
        <li>Between 3 and 4 days: 40% deduction</li>
        <li>Between 4 and 5 days: 50% deduction</li>
      </ul>
    Assignments submitted 5 days or more after the deadline will receive no credit.
    The lowest homework assignment will be dropped.
    This policy does not apply to the final project, which cannot be accepted after the due date except for exceptional circumstances.</p>



      <h4>Tentative Schedule</h4>
      <p>The first half of the course is largely focused on introducing and practicing Python programming through the formatting and visualization of tabular data.  The second half of the course then involves an overview of statistics that can be used to make inferences and predictions from data.</p>
      <p>The tentative schedule below is schedule to change.
      <em>
        The latest schedule is visible on the course homepage and will be updated as the course progresses.

            <h4>Barnard Honor Code</h4>

      <p>
        You are expected to hold yourself to the highest standard of academic integrity and
honesty, as reflected in the Barnard Honor Code. Approved by the student body in
1912 and updated in 2016, the Code states:

</p>

      <blockquote style="margin-left:2em ;margin-right:2em">
  <p>We, the students of Barnard College, resolve to uphold the honor of the College by
engaging with integrity in all of our academic pursuits. We affirm that academic integrity is the honorable creation and presentation of our own work. We acknowledge
that it is our responsibility to seek clarification of proper forms of collaboration and
use of academic resources in all assignments or exams. We consider academic integrity to include the proper use and care for all print, electronic, or other academic
resources. We will respect the rights of others to engage in pursuit of learning in
order to uphold our commitment to honor. We pledge to do all that is in our power
to create a spirit of honesty and honor for its own sake.</p>
</blockquote>

      <h4>Generative AI Policy</h4>
      <p>This course is meant to build your programming skills, so it is not advised to use any generative AI tools for any assignments. This will help you build intuition about how to write code and fix common bugs.  The most productive use of generative AI for this course would be using it as a support tool, such as explaining code snippets from sample code. You are likely better off reading Python documentation or the <a href="https://www.data8.org/fa24/python-reference.html" target="_blank">Data 8 Python Reference</a> as they represent best practices, and generated code may be verbose or potentially incorrect (may not compile).  An over-reliance on AI can hinder independent thinking and creativity.
      </p>
      <p>
      For your final project, AI generated text is <b>not permitted</b> as part of your written descriptions in your final report. Your report must include your own original writing and reflections. Violations can result in a failing grade for the assignment and/or the course.</p>

      <h4>Wellness Statement</h4>
      <p>It is important for undergraduates to recognize and identify the different pressures,
      burdens, and stressors you may be facing, whether personal, emotional, physical,
      financial, mental, or academic. We as a community urge you to make yourself–
      your own health, sanity, and wellness–your priority throughout this term and your
      career here. Sleep, exercise, and eating well can all be a part of a healthy regimen
      to cope with stress. Resources exist to support you in several sectors of your life,
      and we encourage you to make use of them. Should you have any questions about
      navigating these resources, please visit these sites:
      <ul>
        <li><a href="http://barnard.edu/primarycare" target="_blank">http://barnard.edu/primarycare</a></li>
        <li><a href="https://barnard.edu/about-counseling" target="_blank">https://barnard.edu/about-counseling</a></li>
        <li><a href="http://barnard.edu/wellwoman/about" target="_blank">http://barnard.edu/wellwoman/about</a></li>
      </ul>
      </p>

      <h4>Center for Accessibility Resources & Disability Services</h4>
      <p>If you anticipate barriers to your academic experience due to a documented disability or emerging health challenge, please contact your instructor and/or the Center for Accessibility Resources & Disability Services (CARDS) as early as possible. If you have questions regarding registering a disability or receiving accommodations for the semester, contact CARDS at (212) 854-4634 or cards@barnard.edu. You can learn more about on-campus support at barnard.edu/disability-services. CARDS is located in 101 Altschul Hall.</p>


      <h4>Affordable Access to Course Texts and Materials</h4>
      <p>All students deserve to be able to study and make use of course texts and materials regardless of
      cost. Barnard librarians have partnered with students, faculty, and staff to find ways to increase
      student access to textbooks. By the first day of advance registration for each term, faculty will
      have provided information about required texts for each course on CourseWorks (including ISBN
      or author, title, publisher, copyright date, and price), which can be viewed by students. A number
      of cost-free or low-cost methods for accessing some types of courses texts are detailed on the
      Barnard Library Textbook Affordability guide. Undergraduate students who identify as first-
      generation and/or low-income students may check out items from the FLI lending libraries in
      the Barnard Library and in Butler Library for an entire semester. Students may also consult with
      their professors, the Dean of Studies, and the Financial Aid Office about additional affordable
      alternatives for having access to course texts. Visit the guide and talk to your professors and your
      librarian for more details.</p>
