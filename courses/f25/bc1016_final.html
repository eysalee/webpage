      Barnard College</p>

    <br>
    <p>
    <em>This page will be updated with links to the data sets, deadlines, and more information about final report write up. Stay tuned!</em></p>
    <p>The final project for BC1016 provides an opportunity to bring together, apply, and communicate your knowledge of data science and statistics from this course. You will work in groups of 2 to choose one of the provided datasets to analyze and submit a writeup of your analysis and conclusions in the form of a Jupyter Notebook.  </p>
    <!-- <br> -->

    <h4>Project Milestones and Deadlines</h4>
    <p>
    <ol>
      <li><b><u>Group Declaration</u></b>: Deadline TBA
        <br>
      Please read the "Group Guidelines" section for guidelines on how to form your final project groups. We will share a Google form later for students to indicate their groups.</li>

      <li><b><u>Project Proposal</u></b>: Deadline TBA
        <br>
      Each group will select a final project notebook and dataset to work on for the final project and complete the introduction section of the starter notebook.</li>

      <li><b><u>Progress Report</u></b>: Deadline TBA
        <br>
      At this point, groups should be about ~60% done with the final project. For the progress report, groups should list out what analysis remains and how they plan on approaching it. Additionally, groups should share if they are running into any issues with their analysis that they may need assistance with or have questions about.</li>

      <li><b><u>Final Project Report</u></b>: Due <b>Thursday Dec 11</b> at 11:59pm 
        <br>
      Groups will submit the completed reports along with a completed peer review.</li>
    </ol>
    Note: We will require all students to complete a peer review to share how work was distributed among team members. Any major discrepancies in the distribution of work will be factored into individual grades on this assignment.
    <br><br>
    Final Project Grading Breakdown:
    <ul>
      <li>Project Proposal - 10%</li>
      <li>Progress Report - 25%</li>
      <li>Final Report - 65%</li>
    </ul>
    </p>


    <h4>Group Guidelines</h4>
    <p>
      <b>Groups of 2 students in the same lab section</b>
      <br>Ideally, students will find a partner from the same lab section since we will have lab group work time and project consultations during the last two labs
    </p>

    <p>
      <b>Groups of 2 students from <em>different</em> lab sections</b>
      <br>
      If you want to work in a group with a student <em>not</em> in your lab section, you will need to follow extra steps to receive approval:
      <ul>
        <li>Both individuals agree on a lab section they will all attending during the last full week of the semester (12/3 or 12/4).</li>
        <li>In a single email to both 1016 professors (Prof Lee and Prof Megjhani) and your two lab TAs, state your names, what lab section each of you are in, and which lab section you will be attending for the final project consultation in the last lab. To ensure it's not missed, please title your email "[BC1016] Final Project Alice and Bob" where Alice and Bob are replaced with your names.</li>
        <li>One of the professors confirms via email that you have permission to form this group.</li>
      </ul>
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Groups of 3 students</b>
      <br>
      If you would like to work in a group of 3, please note that the final report will have an <em>extra</em> requirement to account for the extra member. Groups of 3 will be required to write up analysis and results of 2 Hypothesis Tests (rather than only 1 Hypothesis Test required for groups of 2).
      <br>
      To receive approval to work in a group of 3, you will need to follow extra steps:
      <ul>
        <li>All three members agree on a lab section they will all attending during the last full week of the semester (12/3 or 12/4).</li>
        <li>
          In a single email to both 1016 professors (Prof Lee and Prof Megjhani) and your lab TAs, state your names, what lab section each of you are in, and which lab section you will be attending for the final project consultation in last lab. To ensure it's not missed, please title your email "[BC1016] Final Project Alice, Bob, and Carol" where Alice, Bob, and Carol are replaced with your names.
        </li>
        <li>One of the professors confirms via email that you have permission to form this group.</li>
      </ul>
    </p>

    <h4>Datasets</h4>
    <p><em>
      Datasets to explore will be released later in the semester. We will also include starter notebooks for these datasets shortly after.</em>
    </p>

    <h4>Report Sections</h4>
    <p><em>More information to be added soon.</em></p>

    <h4>Report Tips</h4>
    <ol>
      <li>Write the report text in a collaborative text editor (such as Google Docs) to be able to work on components of the report with your partner(s). When you're ready, you can copy the final version over to the Jupyter Notebook.</li>
      <li>Communicating your analytical approach is a core component of how your final project is evaluated. Spelling errors, typos, and grammatical errors will be factored into your grade.</li>
      <li>A large part of communicating is being selective with what components of your analysis to report upon. Your final report shouldn't be a walkthrough of your entire process. Rather, you should hone in on the charts and tables that are most important for communicating your results. While you should absolutely explore many paths in your analysis, be judicious about which ones you write about in your final report. If you were reading this report for the first time, what would you find useful for understanding the results? Are there any parts that are unnecessary or distract from the main point?</li>
    </ol>
